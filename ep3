**“Welcome back to Byte2Build!
I’m Indrajit, and today we continue our RedHat Linux journey — a journey that transforms beginners into confident Linux engineers.

In the last episode, we installed RedHat Enterprise Linux, and today the real learning begins. Because RHEL is not something you memorize — it’s something you experience, command by command.

Every enterprise, every DevOps pipeline, every cloud environment depends on strong Linux fundamentals, and RedHat gives you the foundation the industry trusts.

So don’t worry about making mistakes — this is hands‑on, this is practical, and this is how real engineers learn:
One command. One concept. One byte at a time.

Today, we explore the heart of RedHat Linux — the file system and the command line.
Let’s open the terminal… and start building your RedHat skills.”**




Understanding the Linux Prompt: [root@localhost 
When you open a terminal in RedHat (RHEL), you see a prompt like:
[root@localhost ~]#
Here is the full breakdown with deeper technical meaning.________________________________________
🔹 1) root → Superuser Account (UID = 0)
•	root is the administrator of the entire Linux system.
•	It has unrestricted access to all files, processes, services, and settings.
•	In Linux, users are identified by a unique UID (User ID).
✔ Root always has UID = 0
You can check this by running:
id root 
Output example:
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
✔ What UID 0 means:
•	Full control over system
•	Can install/remove packages
•	Can modify system configuration
•	Can create/delete any file
•	Can start/stop system services
•	No restrictions from file permissions
✔ Security Note:
Never use root for regular work — one wrong command can break the entire system.
🔹 2) @localhost → Hostname of the Machine
•	localhost is the default hostname for a system not yet configured.
•	In real servers, you may see names like:
•	app-server1
•	db-prod
•	mail-node01
Check hostname:
hostname 
🔹 3) ~ → Current Working Directory
•	~ means home directory of the current user.
•	For root: /root
•	For user: /home/username
Check current directory:
pwd 
Example:
/root
🔹 4) # → Root Prompt Symbol
•	The last symbol of the prompt shows privilege level:
•	# → root user
•	$ → normal user
This is extremely important when writing scripts or executing commands.
Examples:
[root@localhost ~]#   → full system privileges  
[indrajit@localhost ~]$ → normal user privileges
